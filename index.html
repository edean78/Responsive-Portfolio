            <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/firstdayofschool.jpg" alt="Picture of Ed">
            <p class="aboutme">My name is Ed Dean and I am originally from Mableton, Ga. I now live in Temple, Ga with
                my
                wife Becky and our 2 amazing kids Brooks and Greenlee. I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a
                Bachelor's degree GIS in 2013. I am currently the GIS Manager for Douglas County, Ga. In my spare time I
                enjoy spending time with my family, hunting, fishing, and woodworking.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">In the past 5 years, the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) profession has moved from
                printed maps to Web Mapping. ESRI, our
                software provider, provides plenty out of the box web mapping solutions but if you want to customize an
                application you have to hire a developer. I would like to aquire the skills during this bootcamp to be
                able
                to develope our applications in house. But if another job opportunity presents inself in the future I am
                not
                oppose to a career change. :)</p>
